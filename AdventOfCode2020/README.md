# [AdventOfCode2020](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

I am solving them using python. Solutions are nowhere near cleanest or the most quick. I am doing it just for fun and as coding exercise.
